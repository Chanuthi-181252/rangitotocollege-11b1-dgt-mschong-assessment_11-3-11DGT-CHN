        <h3 id="evolution-process">Evolutionary Processes</h3>
        <p><strong><em>Evolution</em></strong> is the <strong><em>change in allele frequencies</em></strong> in a population over time. Therefore, <strong><em>evolutionary processes</em></strong> are processes that cause <strong><em>changes in allele frequencies</em></strong> in a population over time.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Allele = an alternative version of a gene</li>
          <li>Allele frequency = the precentage (proportion) or each allele in a gene pool</li>
          <li>Population = a group of organisms of the <strong><em>same species</em></strong>, which live in the same place at the same time</li>
          <li>Gene Pool = all the inheritable alleles present (available) in a population</li>
          <li>Genetic diversity = the variation of heritable traits in the population</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong><em>Significance/Importance of Genetic Diversity</em></strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Genetic diversity is important because if there is more genetic variation in a population, it means the population is more likely to be able to survive in a wider variety of environmental conditions and has a greater chance to survive changes in their environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong><em>Mutations</em></strong> - a permanent change in the nucleotide base sequence of DNA</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mutations are the only source of <strong><em>new alleles</em></strong> in individuals and therefore in a gene pool.</li>
          <li>A new unique allele produced by a mutation will <strong><em>increase the size of the gene pool</em></strong> and therefore the genetic variation in the population, but <strong><em>only if the mutation is inheritable</em></strong>.</li>
          <li>If the nutation is expressed in the phenotype then the process of natural selection will work to either increase or decrease its frequency in the population.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong><em>Gene Flow</em></strong> - is the movement of alleles between populations/gene pools when individuals migrate between populations.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Immigration can increase genetic variation because unique alleles may be introduced when immigrants enter a population/gene pool and interbreed, and so it would increase the size of the gene pool.</li>
          <li>Emigration can lower genetic variation because it removes alleles from the population when individuals leave, and so it can decrease allele frequency or if a qunique allele is removed it would decrease the size of the gene pool.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="processes-info">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><strong><em>Selection Pressures</em></strong> - are factors that affect fitness/reproductive sucess and include limits on resources and the existence of threats.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Natural Selection</em></strong> - is the process where <strong><em>environmental factors</em></strong> act as selecting agents and they select for the <strong><em>phenotype</em></strong> that is best suited to the environment. There must be <strong><em>variation in the phenotypes</em></strong> in the population to start with for natural selection to work.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Individuals with the <strong><em>phenotype</em></strong> best suited to the environment have a <strong><em>survival advantage</em></strong> (are 'fitter'), so are <strong><em>more likely to survive</em></strong>, and therefore pass on their <strong><em>alleles for the favouralbe phenotype</em></strong> to offspring more often, which means the <strong><em>frequency</em></strong> of the benefical allele(s) <strong><em>increases</em></strong> in the gene pool.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong><em>Genetic Drift</em></strong> - is the change in the frequency of an existing allele in a population due to random sampling of individuals through chance events.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Founder Effect occurs when a small group of individuals leaves a larger original population and starts a new popultion somewhere else, and because it is a <strong><em>small sample</em></strong> of the origianl population, it is likely the allele frequencies will be different to the original larger population, and so <strong><em>genetic variation will often be reduced</em></strong>.</li>
          <li>Bottleneck Effect is the sudden reduction in the size of a population due to the loss of a large number of individuals, and because it is a <strong><em>small sample</em></strong> of the origianl population, it is likely the allele frequencies will be different to the original larger population, and so <strong><em>genetic variation will often be reduced</em></strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong><em>Patterns of Evolution</em></strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Divergent Evolution
            <br>
            Divergent evolution is splitting of a <strong><em>common ancestral species</em></strong> into two or more species that develop <strong><em>different phenotypes</em></strong> due to becoming specialised to occupy <strong><em>different ecological niches</em></strong>. They have a common direct ancestor but different selective pressures in the different ecological niches result in natural selection favouring different phenotypes, resulting in different species from the common ancestor over time.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Adapative Radiation
            <br>
            Adaptive radiation occurs when a common ancestral species evolves into a <strong><em>large number</em></strong> of new species <strong><em>(rapid speciation into many different forms)</em></strong> due to the availability of <strong><em>many new ecological niches</em></strong> (so the ancestral species moved into each of these available niches, and so was then exposed to different selection pressures in each niche which changed its phenotype / selected for different adaptations). Availabe niches can be made through extinction events or environmental changes.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Convergent Evolution
            <br>
            Convergent evolution is when two or more species from differenet direct ancestors (they do not share a recent common ancestor) evolve <strong><em>similar phenotypes</em></strong> in response to <strong><em>similar niche requirements/environmental selection pressures</em></strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Co-evolution
            <br>
            Co-evolution occurs when different groups of organisms have close ecological relationships, and so they exert selection pressures on each other (they have a strong influence on each other's evolution), and any change in one species acts as a selection pressure that causes/leads to reciprocal changes in the other species. The species develop specific adaptations to changes that occur in the other so that they can <strong><em>continue their existence in the presence of the other</em></strong>. It is most common when a species depends on the other for survival e.g. predator and prey relationships.

            Punctuated Equilibrium
            <br>
            Key points:
            <br>
            <ol>
              <li>A species stays unchanged for a long period of time</li>
              <li>Rapid speciation occurs in a short period of time</li>
              <li>This often occurs because of sudden significant environmental change</li>
              <li>The transitional species may not be seen in the fossil record</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Gradualism 
            <br>
            Key points:
            <br>
            <ol>
              <li>The species are undergoing slow adaptive change continuously</li>
              <li>This is due to constant action of evolutionary processes and changes in selection pressures acting on them</li>
              <li>So new species will appear continually - spread out over the time interval (at different points in time)</li>
              <li>The transitional species should appear in the fossil record as it takes a while for the new species to evolve</li>
            </ol>

        <h3  id="speciation">Speciation</h3>
        <p><strong><em>Speciation</em></strong> - The formation of different species from a common ancestor/ancestral species</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong><em>Species</em></strong> - a group of organisms that can interbreed to produce <strong><em>fertile</em></strong> offspring.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong><em>Speciation (the formation of new species) can only occur if:</em></strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>There is genetic variation in the species/population to begin with, then a group of individuals becomes separated from the common original population/species</li>
          <li>So that there is no gene flow</li>
          <li>And then evolutionary processes increase the genetic vriation between the group and the common original population/species</li>
          <li>Until they are different enough that the group of individuals can no longer successfully reproduce with individuals from the common original population/species, and so they are reproductively isolated from the orginal ancestral species</li>
        </ul>
         
        <p><strong><em>Types of Speciation</em></strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Allopatric speciation: The formation of different species from a common ancestral species after a common original population becomes divided by a physical barrier into two or more geographically isolated populations</li>
          <li>Sympatric speciation: The formation of different species from a common ancestral species in the same geographical area without prior geographical isolation (no geographical barrier - so they live in the same area)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="rim">
        <h3 id="rim">RIMs</h3>
        <p><strong><em>Reproductive Isolating Mechanism (RIM)</em></strong> = a barrier that prevents two organisms from different species from mating and producing fertile offspring / prevents successful interebreeding / prevents gene flow</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Geographical Isolation - when physical barriers separate populations so they cannot come into contact to reprodcue and so there is no gene flow</li>
          <li>Ecological Isolation - individuals of a species live in the same geographical area but differences in habitat/ecological niches results in them rarely coming into contat, so they do not reproduce and so there is no gene flow between them</li>
          <li>Temporal Isolation - differences in the timing of their behaviour e.g. mating is prevented because the two species breed at different times of the year or day</li>
          <li>Structural (mechanical) Isolation - structural shape means that mating is not possible</li>
          <li>Behavioural Isolation - results from differences in behaviour, usually different courtship rituals, so the courship rituals are not recognised and so mating will not occur; or one species might be nocturnal and the other diurnal so they do not come into contact</li>
