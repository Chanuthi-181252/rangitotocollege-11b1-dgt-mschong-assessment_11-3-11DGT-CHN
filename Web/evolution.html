        <p><strong><em>Evolution</em></strong> is the <strong><em>change in allele frequencies</em></strong> in a population over time. Therefore, <strong><em>evolutionary processes</em></strong> are processes that cause <strong><em>changes in allele frequencies</em></strong> in a population over time.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Allele = an alternative version of a gene</li>
          <li>Allele frequency = the precentage (proportion) or each allele in a gene pool</li>
          <li>Population = a group of organisms of the <strong><em>same species</em></strong>, which live in the same place at the same time</li>
          <li>Gene Pool = all the inheritable alleles present (available) in a population</li>
          <li>Genetic diversity = the variation of heritable traits in the population</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong><em>Significance/Importance of Genetic Diversity</em></strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Genetic diversity is important because if there is more genetic variation in a population, it means the population is more likely to be able to survive in a wider variety of environmental conditions and has a greater chance to survive changes in their environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong><em>Mutations</em></strong> - a permanent change in the nucleotide base sequence of DNA</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mutations are the only source of <strong><em>new alleles</em></strong> in individuals and therefore in a gene pool.</li>
          <li>A new unique allele produced by a mutation will <strong><em>increase the size of the gene pool</em></strong> and therefore the genetic variation in the population, but <strong><em>only if the mutation is inheritable</em></strong>.</li>
          <li>If the nutation is expressed in the phenotype then the process of natural selection will work to either increase or decrease its frequency in the population.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong><em>Gene Flow</em></strong> - is the movement of alleles between populations/gene pools when individuals migrate between populations.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Immigration can increase genetic variation because unique alleles may be introduced when immigrants enter a population/gene pool and interbreed, and so it would increase the size of the gene pool.</li>
          <li>Emigration can lower genetic variation because it removes alleles from the population when individuals leave, and so it can decrease allele frequency or if a qunique allele is removed it would decrease the size of the gene pool.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong><em>Selection Pressures</em></strong> - are factors that affect fitness/reproductive sucess and include limits on resources and the existence of threats.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Natural Selection</em></strong> - is the process where <strong><em>environmental factors</em></strong> act as selecting agents and they select for the <strong><em>phenotype</em></strong> that is best suited to the environment. There must be <strong><em>variation in the phenotypes</em></strong> in the population to start with for natural selection to work.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Individuals with the <strong><em>phenotype</em></strong> best suited to the environment have a <strong><em>survival advantage</em></strong> (are 'fitter'), so are <strong><em>more likely to survive</em></strong>, and therefore pass on their <strong><em>alleles for the favouralbe phenotype</em></strong> to offspring more often, which means the <strong><em>frequency</em></strong> of the benefical allele(s) <strong><em>increases</em></strong> in the gene pool.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong><em>Genetic Drift</em></strong> - is the change in the frequency of an existing allele in a population due to random sampling of individuals through chance events.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Founder Effect occurs when a small group of individuals leaves a larger original population and starts a new popultion somewhere else, and because it is a <strong><em>small sample</em></strong> of the origianl population, it is likely the allele frequencies will be different to the original larger population, and so <strong><em>genetic variation will often be reduced</em></strong>.</li>
          <li>Bottleneck Effect is the sudden reduction in the size of a population due to the loss of a large number of individuals, and because it is a <strong><em>small sample</em></strong> of the origianl population, it is likely the allele frequencies will be different to the original larger population, and so <strong><em>genetic variation will often be reduced</em></strong>.</li>
        </ul>
