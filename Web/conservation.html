    <h4>Interventions</h4>
    <ol type="1">
      <li><strong><em>Introduced predators/competitor species</em></strong> - creation of offshore or onshore predator free islands which have predator proof fences and are monitored with cameras, traps, tracking cards and tunnels. <strong><em>(Protected Areas)</em></strong></li>
      <li><strong><em>Restoration of habitat</em></strong> - replanting the natural habitat so specialist species can feed and reproduce in their original habitat.</li>
      <li><stong><em>Establishing new populations</em></stong> in suitable habitats by <strong><em>translocation.</em></strong>
        <ul>
          <li>New populations must be large enough population so inbreeding is minimised and founder effect is not too pronounced. Enough breeding pairs must be translocated to prevent inbreeding depression.</li>
          <li>Populations must be far enough apart so diseases can not be transferred between populations. If one population creashes other popuations ensure the species is not wiped out.</li>
          <li>Transfer birds between populations after they are established to maintain genetic diversity and to prevent RIMs (Reproductive Isolation Mechanisms) forming (eg. behavioural due to birdsong).</li>
          <li>Different populations would be exposed to different selection pressures so the allele frequencies of the populations would differ, increasing genetic diversity.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong><em>Double clutching</em></strong> increases the number of chicks hatched increasing the reproductive rate. Surrogate species may be used to raise these chicks. The surrogate must be a closey related species as the chicks may imprint the behaviour of the parent.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Hand raising chicks in captivitiy</em></strong> to remove risk factors to allow them to survive until adolescence when they can be released. Adolescents are more likely to survive predation.</li>
      <li><strong><em>DNA screening</em></strong> to identify parents with deleterious alleles - selective breeding - do not allow these birds to breed. DNA screening can also identify genetically diverser individuals to increase outbreeding.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Gene Editing</em></strong> - using Crispr to potentially edit harmful alleles from an individual/population.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Wildlife corridors</em></strong> that maintain gene flow between populations/prevent species crossing highways where they can be killed.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Legislate</em></strong> against any human impacts affecting the vulnerable species (eg. bn hunting etc.)</li>
      <li><strong><em>Vaccinations</em></strong> - vaccines can be developed to help prevent spread of pathogens etc.</li>
