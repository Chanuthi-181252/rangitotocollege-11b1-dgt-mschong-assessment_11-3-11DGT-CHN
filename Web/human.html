        <h3 id="cranial">Cranial differences between Apes and Humans</h3>
        <p><strong><em>Foramen Magnum</em></strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The foramen magnum is the opening at the base of the skull where the spinal cord exits the base of the skull.
          <br>
          As the human foramen magnum sits in the middle of the skull, there is balance on the first cervical verterbrate. As a result, there is little energy required to hold the skull upright in constrast to the ape where the foramen magnum lies a lot further back. The large, forward projecting face adds a significant ammount of weight in front of the fulcrum which results in the head to fall forward. 
        </p>

        <p><strong><em>Neck Muscles (Nuchal Crest)</em></strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>
          As a result of the large, forward projecting face, apes rely on large neck muscles to provide support. These muscles attach to the rear of the skull to the vertebrae found in the neck. The point where these neck muscles attach to the skull is called the nuchal crest. This means the large neck muscles in apes, result in larger nuchal crest.
        </p>

        <p><strong><em>Jaw Size</em></strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The human jaw is significantly smaller than the jaw of great apes, which protrudes forward and accounts for a large proportion of the skull. The canines in the great apes are large due to the large canines requried to grind their tough, fibrous vegetation-based diet. In contrast, humans have small canines and the reduction of the jaw can be associated with dietary changes, particularly the emergence of cooked food, which required less chewing and less exaggerated jaw movements.
        </p>

        <p><strong><em>Saggital Crest & Temporal Muscles</em></strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The chewing action of the great ape is significantly more powerful than that of the modern human. To facilitate this, apes have a greater density of temporal muscle, which initiates jaw movement. The need for a greater density of temporal muscle relates to the apes primitive diet that included a lot of tough, fibrous vegetation. The sagittal crest is an attachment area for the temporal muscles; the absence of the sagittal crest in humans coincides with a reduction in temporal muscle. Again, this change can be associated with dietary changes; the consumption of softer foods reduces the need for larger jaw muscles. 
        </p>

        <p><strong><em>Zygomatic Arch & Brow Ridge</em></strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The Zygomatic arch is more prominent in modern humans, in constrast to great apes where the Zygomatic arch is considerably larger to enable the passing of the larger temporal muscle that attaches to the jaw. 
          <br>
          The great apes chewing action brings vertical stresses in the skull. To overcome these stresses, the bony thickening above the eye sockets (brow ridges) are present. In humans, the eye ridges are heavily reduced. This can be linked to dietary changes.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          The change in diet initiated these cranial difference. Brain size increased because of processing food that was easier to chew, providing more energy and initiating a greater protein intake. Along with the increase in the cranial capacity, the increase in the Broca's and Wernicke's areas have improve the cognitive abilites / communication development. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3 id="post-cranial">Post Cranial differences between Apes and Humans</h3>
        <p><strong><em>S-shape spine</em></strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Apes have a C-shaped curve, however, this causes the chest to be positioned in front of the hips and so the great ape relies on a lot of muscular energy to prevent itself from falling over, resulting in the great ape only able to walk on two legs for a short space of time. In constrast, modern humans have an S-shaped spine, which keeps the chest directly above the hips. This ensures the body's centre of mass is directly over the feet, which increases the efficiency of bipedal locomotion.
        </p>

        <p><strong><em>Chest</em></strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The great apes have a chest caity that does not align directly above the hips. The great apes have a deeper chest with greater depth; therefore, its centre of gravity hungs further forward to the base of the spine. In contrast, the chest cavity on moder humans is flatter; ensuring its centre of gravity is aligned to the base of the spine and feet.
        </p>

        <p><strong><em>Pelvis</em></strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The pelvic bone is considerably longer in apes, which means that the distance between the hip joint and sacroiliac joint is considerable. This causes a greater stress on the part of the pelvis that transmits the body weight from the backbone to the hip joint. In humans, the pelvic is shorter, reducing the stress between both the hip joint and sacroiliac joint.
        </p>

        <p><strong><em>Knee Joint</em></strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The valgus angle is the angle that allow the knees to come closer together beneath the backbone. In modern humans, the valgus angle is larger than that of the great ape. Due to the increased valgus angle, each foot is nearly vertically underneath the sping, which reduces the chance of falling sideways when one foot is raised off the ground.
          <br>
          <br>
          At the base of the femur there is buttress of bone called lateral condyle. The great apes have a more rounded lateral condyle in comparison to humans where the lateral condyle is more ovaline. The significance of these centres on the stabilisation of the femur, with the human lateral condyle decreasing the chance of the lower leg tilting during locomotion.
        </p>

        <p><strong><em>Foot</em></strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>
          In humans the foot is arched, which acts as a shock absorber, that is useful for covering long distances. In contrast, the apes have curved toes, which enables them to grip branches. The lack of an arch makes bipedalism difficult for apes.
          <br>
          <br>
          Humans' big toes point forward, this provides forward thrust when walking. In apes, the big toe spreads outwards and does not extend as far forward, it's unable to provide a forward thrust at the end of the stride.
