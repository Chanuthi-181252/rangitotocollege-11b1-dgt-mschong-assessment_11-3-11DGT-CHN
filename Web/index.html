    <h2>Overview:</h2>

    <h3>What is the Biology Scholarship?</h3>
    <p>
      The Biology Scholarship is an 3 hour external examination held at the end of the year, which is based on advance level 3 content.
      Even though the prospect of doing advance level 3 seems intermidating, any students in year groups 11-13 are eligible to take the test.
      With enough determination and commitment anyone with any level of previous biological experience can achieve this scholarship.
    </p>

    <h3>What does it involve?</h3>
    <p>
      The scholarship involves topics including evolution, human evolution, conservation and genetic manipulation.
      However, the exam only has 3 questions, which you must write a written response (essay) in context to each of the question.
      This means that as the examination is only 3 hours, you are advised to spend an hour on each question.

    <h3>Tips and Tricks:</h3>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>First read the question and unpack what it's asking from you. A good way to do this is by underlining or highlighting keywords.</li>
      <li>Find and highlight/underline important or relevant information related to the question in the provided resource.</li>
      <li>Do not repeat your ideas, be concise, this could mark you down!</li>
      <li>Make sure your response answer all aspects of the question.</li>
      <li>Use stats or refer to diagrams and other information provided in the resource sheet.</li>
      <li>Plan your ideas first, take 20 minutes for each question to read the question and unpack the information in the resource sheet. People who tend to get the scholarship have planned their ideas. This will help them make their writing clear.</li>
